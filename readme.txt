Smart Indexing: Creates custom indexes based on your specific query patterns
Automated Optimization: Schedule regular optimizations at your preferred frequency
Multiple Optimization Levels: Choose from low, medium, or high optimization intensity
Comprehensive Reports: Get detailed insights about optimizations performed
Performance Metrics: Measure the impact of optimizations on your database
Email Notifications: Receive reports after each optimization

Why AI Database Optimizer?
Unlike traditional database optimization plugins that apply generic optimizations, AI Database Optimizer analyzes your unique database usage patterns and applies custom optimizations specifically tailored to your WordPress site. This means better performance improvements with lower risk.
Technical Benefits

Reduced query execution time
Lower server resource usage
Smaller database size
Improved overall site performance
Better user experience

Installation

Upload the ai-db-optimizer folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
Go to 'Tools > AI DB Optimizer' to configure settings and run your first analysis

Frequently Asked Questions
Is it safe to use automatic optimization?
Yes. The plugin creates a thorough analysis before performing any optimizations and uses a conservative approach by default. You can also choose the optimization level that matches your comfort level.
How often should I optimize my database?
For most websites, weekly optimization is recommended. High-traffic sites may benefit from daily optimization, while small sites might only need monthly maintenance.
Will this plugin work with my hosting provider?
Yes, AI Database Optimizer works with all major WordPress hosting providers. The plugin respects database resource limitations and performs optimizations in small batches when needed.
Does this plugin modify my database structure?
When using medium or high optimization levels, the plugin may add indexes to your database tables to improve performance. These modifications are standard database optimizations and don't affect your data integrity.
Can I undo optimizations if needed?
While standard optimizations like table defragmentation can't be "undone" (and don't need to be), any indexes created by the plugin can be removed if necessary through the plugin interface.
